        <h2>Why I like to Bake</h2>
            <p>I like to bake for many reasons. One of the main reasons is because I love to gift the things I bake to other people around me like my freinds and family. Baking also allows me to be creative. I can be creative when I am choosing different colors and piping tips when I am frosting a cake. For me and others, It can be a great way to relax, especially when you play music and take your time.</p>
            <p>Another big reason why I bake is to learn life skills that can help me for the rest of my life. I learn how to measure and use observation skills, like when I am checking to see if something is done in the oven. I have recently learned how to make bread which is a staple food in many peoples lives. Baking can also teach you time management and problem solving skills whenn things go wrong. Not only is baking fun, but it is useful!</p>
